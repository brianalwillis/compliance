### *Assessment Type: `Type I`*</br> *Assessment Date: `2025-08-06`*</br> *Auditor: `Briana Willis`*</br> *Client: `[Company Name]`*</br> *Scope: `Systems impacting customer data for the client's SaaS platform`*

## `PURPOSE` OF THE READINESS ASSESSMENT

### *This `SOC 2 Readiness Assessment` was conducted to evaluate `[Client Company]`'s preparedness for a `SOC 2 Type I` audit and to identify gaps in the design and documentation of controls aligned with the `AICPA Trust Services Criteria`:*

### • *`Security` (Required)</br>• `Confidentiality`</br>• Processing Integrity</br>• `Availability`</br>• Privacy*

### The `primary goal` is to ensure the organization has the appropriate `policies`, `procedures`, and `controls` in place and operating effectively *`as of a point in time`*.

## `METHODOLOGY`

### The `readiness assessment` consisted of:
### • *`Reviewing` existing security policies and procedures</br>• `Interviewing` key personnel across IT, HR, DevOps, and management</br>• `Evaluating` current technical and administrative controls</br>• `Mapping` current controls to TSC</br>• `Identifying` control gaps or missing documentation</br>• `Providing` actionable remediation recommendations*

## `KEY OBSERVATIONS` AND `CONTROL GAP` SUMMARY

| *Trust Services Criteria*           | *Observation*                                                                                 | *Status*      | *Recommended Action*                                                                          | 
|:------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *`CC1.2 (Control Environment)`*     | Roles and responsibilities are defined but not formally documented or approved                | *`Not Ready`* | Formalize and approve an organizational chart and job descriptions for key roles              |
| *`CC5.3 (Access Control)`*          | MFA is enforced for VPN and cloud apps, but not for privileged local accounts                 | *`Partial`*   | Enforce MFA on local admin accounts or remove them where not necessary                        |
| *`CC6.6 (System Changes)`*          | Code change management is documented and tracked in GitHub, but lacks formal review sign-offs | *`Partial`*   | Implement a formal peer-review approval workflow in GitHub pull requests                      |
| *`CC7.2 (Security Monitoring)`*     | No SIEM solution in place for log correlation and alerting                                    | *`Not Ready`* | Deploy a basic SIEM solution (e.g., Microsoft Sentinel or Splunk) to monitor critical systems |
| *`CC9.2 (Disposal of Information)`* | No documented procedure for secure data disposal                                              | *`Not Ready`* | Draft and implement a formal data retention and disposal policy                               |

## `REMEDIATION ROADMAP` *(60-90 DAYS)*

| *Timeline*    | *Remediation Task* | 
|:--------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| *`Week 1-2`*  | Finalize control documentation for CC1.2, CC9.2          | 
| *`Week 3-4`*  | 	Deploy MFA on all privileged accounts                  | 
| *`Week 5-6`*  | Configure SIEM for basic log ingestion and alerts        | 
| *`Week 7-8`*  | Update development SOPs to include code review approvals | 
| *`Week 9-10`* | Conduct internal pre-audit testing and walkthroughs      | 

## CURRENT `READINESS SCORE`

| *TSC Category*           | *Readiness Level*     | 
|:-------------------------|:----------------------|
| *`Security`*             | *`70%`*               | 
| *`Availability`*         | *`60%`*               | 
| *`Confidentiality`*      | *`55%`*               | 
| *`Processing Integrity`* | *`N/A`*               | 
| *`Privacy`*              | *`N/A`*               | 

## `CONCLUSION`

### *`[Client Company]`'s has a foundational set of controls in place, especially around `user access`, `cloud security`, and application `change management`.* 

### *However, gaps in `documentation`, `logging`, `monitoring`, and formal `review processes` will need to be addressed before undergoing a successful `SOC 2 Type I` audit.* 

### *A focused `remediation effort` over the next `60–90 days` is recommended to close identified gaps and align with `SOC 2 audit` requirements.*
